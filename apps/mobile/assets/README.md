# Assets Directory

This directory contains images, fonts, and other static assets for the mobile app.

## Required Assets

To run the app properly, you'll need to add the following assets:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (1284x2778 for iOS)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48)

For now, these are placeholders. Replace them with your actual app assets.

You can generate these using [Expo's asset generator](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/splash-screen-and-app-icon/).
